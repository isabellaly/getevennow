<h5><a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/book/106602/negotiation-genius-by-deepak-malhotra-and-max-bazerman"> Negotiation Genius</a>, Deepak Malhotra and Max Bazerman</h5>From two leaders in executive education at Harvard Business School, here are the mental habits and proven strategies you need to achieve outstanding results in any negotiation.   Whether you've "seen it all" or are just starting out, Negotiation Genius will dramatically improve your negotiating skills and confidence. Drawing on decades of behavioral research plus the experience of thousands of business clients, the authors take the mystery out of preparing for and executing negotiations-whether they involve multimillion-dollar deals or improving your next salary offer.</li><li><h5><a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Getting_to_yes.html?id=sjh5emOkC1MC">Getting to Yes</a>, Roger Fisher, William Ury, and Bruce Patton</h5>Since its original publication in 1981, Getting to Yes has been translated into 18 languages and has sold over 1 million copies in its various editions. This completely revised edition is a universal guide to the art of negotiating personal and professional disputes. It offers a concise strategy for coming to mutually acceptable agreements in every sort of conflict.</li><li><h5><a href="http://www.williamury.com/books/getting-past-no">Getting Past No</a>, William Ury</h5>Getting Past No is the state-of-the-art book on negotiation for the twenty-first century. It will help you deal with tough times, tough people, and tough negotiations. You don't have to get mad or get even.

According to the authors, this tactical focus leaves money on the table and is often inadequate for tough negotiations when the other side holds all the cards. It isn't well-suited to common deal-making challenges such as multiple parties, tricky internal and external negotiations, and shifting agendas.   Filled with real examples, 3-D Negotiation maps out the missing dimensions - deal design and setup - that underpin effective tactics.</li><li><h5><a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Essentials_of_Negotiation.html?id=__eoPwAACAAJ">Essentials of Negotiation</a>, Roy Lewicki, David Saunders and John Minton</h5>Essentials of Negotiation explores the major concepts and theories of the psychology of bargaining and negotiation, and the dynamics of interpersonal and inter-group conflict and its resolution. Twelve of the 20 chapters from the main text have been included in this edition, several chapters having been condensed for this volume. Those condensed chapters have shifted from a more research-oriented focus to a more fundamental focus on issues such as critical negotiation subprocesses, multiparty negotiations, and the influence of international and cross-cultural differences on the negotiation process.</li><li><h5><a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Shaping_the_game.html?id=_2m7q2q36yIC">Shaping the Game</a>, Michael Watkins</h5>In Shaping the Game: The New Leader's Guide to Effective Negotiating, Watkins draws from extensive research and practical consulting work to reveal four fundamental objectives that should guide new leaders' actions in every negotiation they undertake: create the most possible value, capture that value for yourself and your company, carefully tend to key relationships, and preserve your reputation. Watkins lays out hands-on strategies for becoming a world-class negotiator, including how to match your negotiation strategy to the situation, influence the perspectives of key counterparts, shape negotiation outcomes in your favor, and create the learning discipline necessary to become a world-class negotiator. Navigating the myriad complex, high-stakes negotiating challenges that confront new leaders, this book provides all the tools readers need to make the right moves up the career ladder--and succeed in those roles once they get there.</li><li><h5><a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_mind_and_heart_of_the_negotiator.html?id=zD8sAQAAIAAJ">The Mind and Heart of the Negotiator</a>, Leigh Thompson</h5>This book presents a unified, integrated, and comprehensive overview of the insights, strategies, and practices inherent to successful negotiations. This unique book weaves together a wide range of disciplines, including economics, psychology, sociology, communication, and organizational behavior. The book gradually builds the complexity of information presented from early to later chapters as well as within each chapter. It reveals the interrelation of the economics and the psychology of negotiation. It also discusses the influence of technology on communication and social interaction. It is an essential resource for any professional or individual who wishes to strengthen their negotiating skills.</li><li><h5><a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Get_paid_what_you_re_worth.html?id=bwmBqgKIiXUC">Get Paid What You're Worth</a>, Robin Pinkley and Gregory Northcroft</h5>Whether you're entering the workforce for the first time, making a job change, or seeking better compensation for your contributions, Robin L.

Get Paid What You're Worth is the handbook you need to successfully navigate the business of negotiation.</li><li><h3>Negotiation Books for Women</h3></li><li><h5><a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7575.html">Women Don't Ask</a>, Linda Babcock and Sara Laschever</h5>"By looking at the barriers holding women back and the social forces constraining them, Women Don't Ask shows women how to reframe their interactions and more accurately evaluate their opportunities. It teaches them how to ask for what they want in ways that feel comfortable and possible, taking into account the impact of asking on their relationships.
